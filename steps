Steps: 

We'd like to retrieve the following:
8. brand [first word(s), discovered by pattern recognition]
4. way of powering the device  [ text filtering]( first because unambigious)
2. material [text filtering]
1. colour [text filtering]
3. size [interpretation]

5. all other features
6. the product type
7. product group


how to conduct filtering when having list of possibilities at hand:
1.  first pass stuff trough linguistic model if not allready done (only when available)
2. Look for possible values (we have conducted a list of possible values at this point) within text
3. when ambiguous (colour and material) look for a value of the other type before settling with the conclusion of your first discovered value( E.G. silver stainless steel watch should give silver as colour and stainless steel as material)
4. delete the text from the working copy of the original material to make subsequent searches eazyer
